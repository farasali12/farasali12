<h1>Hi, I’m Faras Ali</h1>

<p>
I’m a cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience across endpoint
security, incident response, penetration testing, and security monitoring.
I build practical attacker/defender labs to understand real-world threats
and focus strongly on detection, response, containment, and ethical
security practices.
